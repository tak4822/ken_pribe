        <p class="about-text">
            I grew up in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, living an adventurous & creative childhood shaped and warped by cartoons, books, puppets and animatronic rock bands.
            <br><br>
            I’ve studied film & animation at University of Michigan School of Art & Design and Vancouver Institute of Media Arts (VanArts), and now live near Vancouver Canada.
            <br><br>
            Over the years I have worked on several animated short films for Scholastic/Weston Woods at BigFott Studios, written two books about stop-motion animation, taught courses for Academy of Art University, and offered animation workshops for kids.
            <br><br>
            By day I am Communications Manager at VanArts. By night I write, draw, teach, animate, read to my kids and battle evil (sometimes wearing a cape). On occasion, I also write reflective essays about film, books & music (over at <a href="http://www.priebelieving.com/" class="about-link">my blog</a> )

            Currently I am writing and illustrating a collection of poems to be published as books for young people of all ages, and documenting the production process at <a href="http://gnomesofthecheeseforest.blogspot.ca/" class="about-link">my other blog</a>
